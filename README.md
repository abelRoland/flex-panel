# Flex Panels Image Gallery

This is a simple static website which enables user to flex a gallery of images when click on it. 

You can check it out live page from this [link](abelroland.github.io/flex-panel/).

This project was created from the tutorials of [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/tree/master/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit) . We recommend you to watch his tutorials.

This is a good tutorial to practice separation of concern for web developer.
